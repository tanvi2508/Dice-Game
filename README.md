Games Rules:
The dice game is called "Roll the Dice" and is a simple two-player game. The rules and more information about the game can be found here on its Wikipedia page, but the simple rules are as follows:

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

* If the player 1 rolls a die, they score greater then other player than player 1 will win the game.
* If the player 2 rolls a die, they score greater then other player than player 2  will win the game.
* If both players get equal number of die then the game will draw or tie.
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
